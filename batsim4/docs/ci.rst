- Main CI script is :download:`.gitlab-ci.yml <../.gitlab-ci.yml>` (from Batsim's repository root directory).
- CI logs are available on `Batsim's Framagit Pipelines`_.
- Docker image used for tests is defined in :download:`env/docker/Dockerfile <../env/docker/Dockerfile>` (from Batsim's repository root directory).
- Give a look at CI's script to reproduce locally.
  Enable Batsim's Cachix cache to not recompile dependencies: ``cachix add batsim``.

Additionnally, a Batsim container is deployed on Dockerhub_ for each commit on the master branch.
This is done on `GitHub Actions`_ whose script is defined in :download:`build-docker-containers.yml <../.github/workflows/build-docker-containers.yml>` (from Batsim's repository root directory).
